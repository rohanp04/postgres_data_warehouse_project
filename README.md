# PostgreSQL Data Warehouse 

Welcome to the PostgreSQL Data Warehouse and Analytics Project! 🚀  
This project showcases a complete data warehousing and analytics solution, built using **PostgreSQL**. It demonstrates the end-to-end process of data ingestion, transformation, and analysis, following industry best practices in **data engineering** and **analytics**.  

## 🏗️ Data Architecture  
The data architecture is designed using the **Medallion Architecture**, incorporating three structured layers:  

- **Bronze Layer** 🟤: Raw data ingestion from various sources, ensuring minimal preprocessing.  
- **Silver Layer** ⚪: Data cleansing, transformation, and normalization to create a structured and consistent format.  
- **Gold Layer** 🟡: Aggregated and enriched data for analytics, reporting, and business intelligence.  

This project provides a practical and scalable approach to data warehousing, leveraging **PostgreSQL** as the core database technology to ensure efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of data.
